# Text-Based Adventure Creator - Turn data into a TBA game!

Remember that classic game genre? The "Text-Based Adventure"? If you were born after the
early nineties, maybe not.

But anyway, for those of us who *do* recall those sessions staring at a terminal-esque window,
considering which direction to take at the fork in the forest path, this is **your** chance to
create you very own Text-Based Adventure story/game/experience.

## Support

Currently support is only provided for the command line and has been tested in macOS and Windows.
However, depending on the success of this iteration, support may be added in the future for
running in the browser, opening up possibilities like displaying graphics or having fancy
input methods.

I/O handling was strictly decoupled from any core logic, so adding support for new interfaces
later should not be too difficult.

## About

TBA Creator was built using TypeScript for a bit of fun and exploration. I was heavily inspired
by some of the games of my youth like Zork and Choose Your Own Adventure books.
